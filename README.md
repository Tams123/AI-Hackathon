Machine Learning For HR Analytics
Business problem :
One of the major problems that every organization faces irrespective of the work sector is Employee Attrition. The application of proper strategies and ideas are required to control this growing employee attrition rate. The aim of this project is to explore employee attrition dataset to answer important questions about attrition and thereby, provide recommendations to increase employee retention
Solution:
So here I am going to build a machine learning model using a dataset which has two sets -Existing Employees and Employees those have left the organization.My ML model is going to predict the type of Employees leaving the organization and who are prove to leave¶¶
We use Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine as classifier for employee attrition and measure the accuracy of models that are built.
Each row in dataset represents an employee; each column contains employee attributes:
Satisfaction Level
Last evaluation
Number of projects
Average monthly hours
Time spent at the company
Whether they have had a work accident
Whether they have had a promotion in the last 5 years
Departments (column sales)
Salary
Whether the employee has left
